# PScout 1 parser and smali converter

PScout is a tool to analyze the Android system and to create a mapping for system calls and their respective permissions. As PScout 2.0 creates corrupt mappings, the only viable mappings are from PScout 1, supporting Android 2.2.3-4.1.1 . The mappings, created by PScout 1 can be downloaded [here](http://pscout.csl.toronto.edu/downloads.php).
